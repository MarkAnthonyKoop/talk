# Claude Code Test Prompt - Hello World Investigation

Please execute the following steps to help us understand how Claude Code handles file creation and output:

## Step 1: Create a Hello World Python script

Create a file called `hello_world.py` with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Hello World test script created by Claude Code
Created at: [please add timestamp]
"""

def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
    print("This script was created by Claude Code")
    print("Testing output mechanisms...")
    
    # Create a test output file
    with open("hello_output.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("Hello from Claude Code!\n")
        f.write("This file was created to test file generation.\n")
    
    print("✓ Output file created: hello_output.txt")
    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exit(main())
```

## Step 2: Create a test runner script

Create a file called `run_test.py` with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Test runner to verify Claude Code's file creation"""

import os
import subprocess
import json
from datetime import datetime

# Check what files exist
files_created = []
for file in ["hello_world.py", "hello_output.txt", "run_test.py"]:
    if os.path.exists(file):
        files_created.append(file)

# Run hello_world if it exists
if os.path.exists("hello_world.py"):
    result = subprocess.run(["python3", "hello_world.py"], 
                          capture_output=True, text=True)
    stdout = result.stdout
    stderr = result.stderr
else:
    stdout = "hello_world.py not found"
    stderr = ""

# Create a report
report = {
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "files_created": files_created,
    "hello_world_output": stdout,
    "hello_world_errors": stderr,
    "working_directory": os.getcwd()
}

# Save report
with open("claude_test_report.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(report, f, indent=2)

print("Test Report:")
print(json.dumps(report, indent=2))
print("\n✓ Report saved to: claude_test_report.json")
```

## Step 3: Execute the test

Run the test runner:

```bash
python3 run_test.py
```

## Step 4: List all files created

Show me what files were created:

```bash
ls -la *.py *.txt *.json 2>/dev/null
```

## Step 5: Display the output

Please show the contents of:
1. The stdout from running the scripts
2. Any files that were created
3. A summary of what happened

## Expected Behavior Analysis

Based on this test, we want to understand:
1. **Does Claude Code create actual .py files on disk?**
2. **What appears in stdout vs what's written to files?**
3. **How does Claude Code report its actions?**
4. **What's the difference between file creation output and console output?**

Please execute all steps and provide a complete summary of what happened.
