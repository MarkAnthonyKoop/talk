# ExecutionPlannerAgent Tests

This directory contains tests for the ExecutionPlannerAgent and its integration with the Talk orchestration system.

## Test Files

- `test_execution_planner_agent.py` - Unit test for ExecutionPlannerAgent return type validation
- `test_talk_integration.py` - Integration test with TalkOrchestrator

## Key Testing Discoveries

### ExecutionPlannerAgent Architecture
The ExecutionPlannerAgent is designed to return `List[Step]` objects, not string descriptions. This is fundamental to the Talk orchestration architecture:

- **Correct**: `def run(self, input_text: str) -> List[Step]`
- **Incorrect**: `def run(self, input_text: str) -> str`

### Pydantic Validation Error Resolution
During testing, we discovered the original Pydantic validation error was caused by the ExecutionPlannerAgent returning a string instead of `List[Step]`. The error was:

```
ValidationError: ExecutionPlannerAgent returned string instead of List[Step]
```

This was fixed by reverting the `run()` method to return the actual Step objects instead of a description string.

### Test Results
- ✅ ExecutionPlannerAgent generates 5 Step objects correctly
- ✅ TalkOrchestrator completes workflows successfully (exit code 0)
- ✅ No Pydantic validation errors
- ✅ File operations work as expected

### Architecture Principle Validated
The tests confirmed the core architectural principle: agents can be arbitrarily complex internally as long as they honor the interface contract of `prompt in → completion out` plus side effects.
