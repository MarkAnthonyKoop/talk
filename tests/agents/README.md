# Agent Tests Directory

This directory contains test suites for specialized agents in the Talk framework.

## Test Structure

Tests are organized by agent type:
- `refinement_agent_test.py` - Comprehensive test suite for RefinementAgent with 10 test cases
- Each test uses mock-based testing to isolate agent behavior
- Tests validate both successful and failure scenarios

## RefinementAgent Test Results

The RefinementAgent tests revealed:

### Successful Operations
- ✅ Successfully encapsulates code→test→evaluate→refine loops
- ✅ Proper JSON result structure with status, iterations, improvements
- ✅ Handles up to 5 iterations with quality gates
- ✅ Mock-based testing works reliably

### Environmental Dependencies
- ⚠️ RefinementAgent depends on pytest for testing but it's not installed
- ⚠️ This suggests need for an InstallationAgent for environment management
- ⚠️ Tests pass but actual runs may fail due to missing dependencies

### Architecture Insights
The RefinementAgent successfully demonstrates the principle of complex agents built from simpler agents:
- Uses CodeAgent, FileAgent, and TestAgent internally
- Provides higher-level abstraction for iterative development
- Maintains simple interface: prompt in → JSON completion out

## Testing Best Practices
- Use subdirectories under tests/ for organization
- Mock external dependencies for reliable testing
- Test both success and failure paths
- Validate return formats and data structures
