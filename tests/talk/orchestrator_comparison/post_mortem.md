# Talk Framework Post-Mortem: Orchestration Task Failure

## Executive Summary
Talk failed to complete the "build an agentic orchestration system" task due to API rate limits, file persistence issues, and excessive orchestration overhead.

## Failure Analysis

### 1. Rate Limit Issues
**Problem**: Hit Anthropic API rate limits (40,000 input tokens/minute)
- Occurred after ~5 minutes of execution
- Multiple 429 errors with increasing backoff times
- Eventually exceeded both standard and acceleration limits

**Root Causes**:
- Each agent call includes full conversation history
- Blackboard context grows with each step
- No batching or rate limit awareness
- No token counting before API calls

### 2. File Persistence Failure
**Problem**: Generated code was saved to `.talk_scratch` but never written to workspace
- CodeAgent saved 4 files to scratch
- FileAgent was never invoked to apply the files
- Generated code was lost when process terminated

**Root Causes**:
- Workflow jumped from code generation to testing
- Missing explicit file application step
- FileAgent not automatically triggered after CodeAgent

### 3. Orchestration Overhead
**Problem**: Complex multi-agent orchestration for a straightforward task
- 7 different agents involved (Planning, Branching, Code, File, Test, Research, Error Recovery)
- Each decision required full LLM call
- Simple decisions (like "what to do next") consumed thousands of tokens

**Root Causes**:
- Over-engineered for the task complexity
- No fast-path for simple operations
- Every decision goes through BranchingAgent

### 4. Context Explosion
**Problem**: Blackboard entries grew exponentially
- Each agent appends to blackboard
- Full context passed to every agent
- By iteration 10, context was >20K tokens

**Root Causes**:
- No context pruning or summarization
- All history retained indefinitely
- No distinction between critical and auxiliary information

### 5. Error Recovery Issues
**Problem**: Error recovery led to loops instead of resolution
- Missing pytest dependency triggered error recovery
- Error recovery just went back to planning
- No actual resolution of the underlying issue

**Root Causes**:
- Error recovery agent doesn't have capability to fix dependencies
- No distinction between recoverable and non-recoverable errors
- Circular flow: error → planning → same action → same error

## Successful Elements

### What Worked Well:
1. **Research Phase**: Successfully completed initial research
2. **Code Generation**: Generated reasonable base architecture
3. **Planning**: Created logical todo hierarchy
4. **Agent Communication**: Agents successfully passed data via blackboard

## Recommendations for v10

### 1. Rate Limit Management
```python
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, tokens_per_minute=30000, calls_per_minute=20):
        self.token_bucket = TokenBucket(tokens_per_minute)
        self.call_bucket = TokenBucket(calls_per_minute)
    
    def wait_if_needed(self, estimated_tokens):
        # Check and wait if necessary
        wait_time = max(
            self.token_bucket.time_until_available(estimated_tokens),
            self.call_bucket.time_until_available(1)
        )
        if wait_time > 0:
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```

### 2. Context Management
```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens=10000):
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
    
    def prune_context(self, blackboard):
        # Keep only recent and critical entries
        critical = self.get_critical_entries(blackboard)
        recent = self.get_recent_entries(blackboard, n=5)
        return self.summarize_if_needed(critical + recent)
```

### 3. File Persistence Pipeline
```python
class PersistencePipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pending_files = []
    
    def on_code_generated(self, files):
        # Automatically queue for persistence
        self.pending_files.extend(files)
    
    def flush_to_workspace(self):
        # Write all pending files
        for file in self.pending_files:
            self.write_to_workspace(file)
```

### 4. Simplified Orchestration
```python
class SimplifiedOrchestrator:
    def execute_task(self, task):
        # Direct execution for simple tasks
        if self.is_simple_task(task):
            return self.fast_path_execution(task)
        
        # Full orchestration only for complex tasks
        return self.full_orchestration(task)
```

### 5. Dependency Resolution
```python
class DependencyResolver:
    def resolve_missing_dependency(self, dep_name, install_cmd):
        # Actually install the dependency
        subprocess.run(install_cmd, shell=True)
        return self.verify_installation(dep_name)
```

## Model Selection Strategy

### Testing Order:
1. **Gemini** (free, fast) - Test rate limit solutions
2. **Sonnet** (paid, balanced) - Test if quality improves
3. **Opus** (paid, powerful) - Test if architecture is limiting factor

### Expected Outcomes:
- **If Gemini succeeds**: Rate limits were the issue
- **If Sonnet succeeds but Gemini fails**: Model capability issue
- **If Opus succeeds but Sonnet fails**: Task complexity issue
- **If all fail**: Architectural issue in Talk

## Critical Fixes for v10

1. **Token-aware API calls**: Count tokens before calling
2. **Automatic file persistence**: Write files immediately after generation
3. **Context pruning**: Keep context under 10K tokens
4. **Smart routing**: Skip orchestration for simple operations
5. **Actual error resolution**: Fix issues, don't just report them
6. **Batch operations**: Group related API calls
7. **Caching**: Cache repeated decisions and lookups

## Success Metrics for v10

- Complete orchestration task in <10 minutes
- Stay under rate limits
- Generate and persist all files
- Maintain context under 10K tokens
- Successfully recover from errors
- Produce working code comparable to Claude Code's output
