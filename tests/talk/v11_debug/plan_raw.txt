The core components handle data storage and retrieval, with separate layers for caching, indexing, and transaction management. The API layer provides multiple interfaces for clients, while utility components handle cross-cutting concerns. The implementation order ensures that fundamental components are built first, followed by dependent features. The testing infrastructure is comprehensive and includes performance benchmarks. The system is designed to be production-ready with proper error handling, monitoring, and configuration management."
