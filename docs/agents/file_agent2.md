# FileAgent (Enhanced Version)

The enhanced FileAgent is a sophisticated code editor that implements multiple editing paradigms, including Aider-style SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for precise code modifications.

## Overview

This version transforms the simple patch applier into a comprehensive file editing system that supports:

- SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for precise edits
- Multiple file formats and editing strategies
- File creation with proper formatting
- Validation and error recovery
- Backward compatibility with legacy formats

## Architecture Comparison

### Original FileAgent (tmp/file_agent.py)
- **Purpose**: Unix patch command wrapper
- **Input**: Unified diff text
- **Output**: Patch application status
- **Size**: 78 lines
- **Method**: `subprocess.run(["patch", "-p0"])`

### Enhanced FileAgent
- **Purpose**: Multi-paradigm code editor
- **Input**: SEARCH/REPLACE blocks or structured commands
- **Output**: Detailed edit results per file
- **Size**: 352 lines
- **Method**: Direct text manipulation with validation

## Key Features

### SEARCH/REPLACE Format
Supports Aider-style precise editing:

```
filename.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
old code here
=======
new code here
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Multiple Input Formats
1. **SEARCH/REPLACE blocks**: Primary editing method
2. **CREATE_FILE commands**: Legacy compatibility
3. **MODIFY_FILE commands**: Structured modifications
4. **Auto-detection**: Intelligent format recognition

### Advanced Parsing
- Multi-file operation support
- Indentation preservation
- Content validation
- Error recovery and reporting

### File Operations
- **Create**: New file generation with proper formatting
- **Edit**: Precise in-place modifications
- **Validate**: Content verification before writing
- **Backup**: Implicit safety through validation

## Error Handling

The enhanced FileAgent provides robust error handling:
- Parse multiple format attempts
- Validate search blocks exist before replacement
- Report specific failures per file
- Graceful degradation to simpler operations

## Integration Benefits

Works with the enhanced CodeAgent to provide:
- Seamless multi-file operations
- Precise code editing without patch failures
- Better error reporting and recovery
- Support for complex refactoring tasks

## When to Use

Enhanced FileAgent excels at:
- Precise code modifications within files
- Multi-file editing operations
- Complex refactoring requiring accuracy
- Integration with AI-generated code changes

Original FileAgent remains suitable for:
- Simple patch application
- Unix-style tool integration
- Minimal dependency scenarios
- Direct diff application workflows

## Performance Considerations

The enhanced version trades simplicity for capability:
- Higher memory usage due to file content processing
- More complex error scenarios
- Better accuracy for precise edits
- Reduced dependency on external patch tools
