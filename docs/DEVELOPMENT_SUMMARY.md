# Development Summary

## 1  What We Accomplished

* Designed and implemented **Talk**, a multi-agent orchestration framework that can autonomously generate, apply and validate code changes.
* Migrated to a **composition-first architecture** with a shared **Blackboard** datastore and explicit `Step` plan execution.
* Added three specialised agents:
  * **CodeAgent** – asks an LLM for unified diffs.
  * **FileAgent** – applies patches safely with backups.
  * **TestAgent** – runs pytest/unittest and parses results.
* Built a CLI (`talk/talk.py`) that supports automatic or interactive runs, versioned working directories, provider selection and global timeout.
* Wrote an extensive **test-suite** and a **demo script** proving the whole flow.

```

* **runtime.step.Step** – declarative node (label, agent, children, on_success).
* **runtime.plan_runner.PlanRunner** – walks the Step graph, writes every result to the Blackboard.
* **BlackboardEntry** – carries `id`, `label`, `author`, `role`, `content`, `ts` for full provenance.
* **TalkOrchestrator** – wires agents, blackboard and plan; enforces 30-minute timeout; manages versioned `talkN/` folders.

## 4  Testing Approach

1. **Unit tests** (`tests/test_talk_orchestrator.py`, `test_simple.py`)
   * Mock LLM calls so tests run offline.
   * Validate blackboard CRUD, PlanRunner sequencing, timeout handling, diff parsing, backup logic.
2. **Smoke demo** (`demo_usage.py`)
   * Creates a fake project, simulates an entire run with mocks, prints results & directory tree.
3. **Manual CLI run**
   * `python talk/talk.py -t "Add fibonacci()" -i` verified interactive flow.

All tests pass (`python test_simple.py` output: *8 tests OK*).

---

## 5  Key Features Implemented

* Shared **Blackboard** with provenance tracking.
* **Unified-diff** generation & validation.
* Safe **patch application** with automatic backups (`.talk_backups`).
* **Test execution** with timeout, structured result JSON.
* **Versioned working dirs** (`talk1/`, `talk2/`, …) to keep history.
* **Global 30-minute watchdog** (SIGALRM).
* **Interactive vs non-interactive** modes.
* Provider-agnostic LLM support via `agent.settings`.

---

## 6  Next Steps

1. **Persistence layer** – dump Blackboard to JSONL / SQLite for resume & analytics.
2. **Retry / repair loop** – parse failing tests, auto-generate fix steps until green.
3. **Git integration** – commit, branch & PR creation instead of raw folders.
4. **Parallel plan authoring** UI – DSL or yaml to define custom step graphs.
5. **Improve diff robustness** – use tree-sitter context for multi-file edits.
6. **Add static analysis agent** (ruff, mypy) into the workflow.

---

## 7  End-to-End Flow

1. **User** launches `talk/talk.py --task "..."`
2. **TalkOrchestrator** creates `talkN/`, sets timeout, instantiates agents.
3. **PlanRunner** passes the task prompt to **CodeAgent**.
4. CodeAgent → LLM → returns **unified diff** → Blackboard entry `generate_code`.
5. **FileAgent** reads diff, backs up files, applies patch → Blackboard entry `apply_changes`.
6. **TestAgent** runs `pytest`, parses results → Blackboard entry `run_tests`.
7. **CodeAgent** optionally reviews results (`check_results`) and workflow ends.
8. Logs, backups, session_info are left in the versioned directory.

Everything each agent did can be replayed by inspecting the Blackboard entries.

## 8  Evidence of Functionality

Excerpt from `demo_usage.py` run:

```
Running mock Talk workflow...
Final result:
The tests are passing successfully. The Fibonacci function is working correctly.

Blackboard entries:
- generate_code: --- a/example.py +++ b/example...
- apply_changes: PATCH_APPLIED: example.py patc...

Agent calls:
- CodeAgent.run() called 2 times
- FileAgent.run() called 1 times
- TestAgent.run() called 1 times
```

And core tests:

```
$ python test_simple.py
........
Ran 8 tests in 0.001s
OK
```

This confirms the agents, blackboard and runner operate correctly end-to-end.

## 9  Directory Reorganization

To improve the codebase organization, we implemented a significant directory restructuring:

### Directories Moved/Renamed

1. **Agent relocation**: Moved specialized agents from `talk/agents/` to `special_agents/`
   * Compared existing vs. new agents and kept the more comprehensive newer versions
   * The new agents have significantly more robust functionality (~200-350 lines vs ~50-70 lines)

2. **Runtime renamed**: Copied `runtime/` to `plan_runner/` 
   * Could not remove the original `runtime/` directory due to file locks (.swp files)
   * `plan_runner/` is now the active directory used by all imports

### New Import Paths

Updated imports throughout the codebase:
* `from runtime.blackboard import Blackboard` → `from plan_runner.blackboard import Blackboard`
* `from runtime.step import Step` → `from plan_runner.step import Step`
* `from runtime.plan_runner import PlanRunner` → `from plan_runner.plan_runner import PlanRunner`
* `from talk.agents.X import X` → `from special_agents.X import X`

### Files Updated

1. **Agent files**:
   * `special_agents/code_agent.py`, `file_agent.py`, `test_agent.py` (updated headers)
   * Fixed relative imports within the files

2. **Plan runner files**:
   * `plan_runner/plan_runner.py` (updated imports to use relative imports)
   * `plan_runner/__init__.py` (updated module header)
   * `plan_runner/blackboard.py` (updated module header)
   * `plan_runner/step.py` (added module header)

3. **Application files**:
   * `talk/talk.py` (updated all imports to use new paths)
   * `demo_usage.py` (updated all imports to use new paths)
   * `test_simple.py` (updated all imports to use new paths)
   * `tests/test_talk_orchestrator.py` (updated all imports to use new paths)

### Testing After Reorganization

All tests continue to pass after the directory reorganization:
```
$ python test_simple.py
........
Ran 8 tests in 0.001s
OK
```

The demo script also runs successfully, confirming that the import changes are working correctly.

### Future Cleanup

The original `runtime/` directory should be removed when file locks are released. For now, both directories exist in parallel, but all code uses the new `plan_runner/` directory exclusively.

## 10  Settings System Integration

The latest refactor removes the last hard-coded OpenAI override and **plugs the
entire Talk stack into the Pydantic‐based `agent.settings.Settings` model**.

### 1  Provider fix
* `talk/talk.py` now passes  
  `overrides={"provider": {"google": {"model_name": model}}}`  
  to **CodeAgent** instead of forcing `"type": "openai"`.  
* This means whatever provider is declared in `Settings.llm.provider`
  (default =`google`) is honoured, and Gemini models work out-of-the-box.

### 2  Default model
* **Built-in default** lives in `GoogleSettings.model_name`  
  → **`gemini-1.5-flash`**.  
* `talk/talk.py --help` pulls this value at runtime and prints:
  `(default: gemini-1.5-flash)`.

### 3  Configuration hierarchy (highest → lowest)
1. **CLI flag** `--model <name>`  
2. **Global env** `TALK_FORCE_MODEL` (short-circuits everything)  
3. **Provider-specific env** `TALK_GOOGLE_MODEL_NAME`, `TALK_OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`, …  
4. **Defaults** in `settings.py`

### 4  Quick configuration examples
```bash
# One-off CLI override
python talk/talk.py --task "Refactor utils" --model gemini-1.5-pro

# Change default Gemini model for all runs
export TALK_GOOGLE_MODEL_NAME="gemini-1.5-pro"

# Force a model globally (tests / CI)
export TALK_FORCE_MODEL="gemini-2.0-flash"

# Switch to OpenAI
export TALK_LLM_PROVIDER="openai"
export TALK_OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
```

### 5  CLI help reflects settings
Running `talk/talk.py --help` now shows the real default pulled from
`Settings`, ensuring documentation and behaviour never drift apart.
