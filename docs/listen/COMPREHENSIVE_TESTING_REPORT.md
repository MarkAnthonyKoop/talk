# Comprehensive Testing Report - Listen v4

## ✅ TESTING COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY

### Summary
After implementing "no mocking" policy and comprehensive testing, Listen v4 has been thoroughly validated with **real implementations** and **extensive test coverage**.

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed All Default Mocking**
- **Before**: Agents defaulted to `use_mock=True`
- **After**: Agents require real dependencies or fail with clear errors
- **Loud Warnings**: When forced to use mocking, system shows prominent warnings

### 2. **Mandatory Dependencies**
- All audio libraries now required: `torch`, `torchaudio`, `scipy`, `speechbrain`  
- Missing dependencies cause immediate failure with installation instructions
- No silent fallbacks to mock behavior
