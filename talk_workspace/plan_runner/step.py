# plan_runner/step.py
#
# Changes from Original & Architectural Theory:
# The original `Step` class was a simple Python class. This has been converted
# to a `dataclass` for convenience and clarity.
#
# The architectural changes are significant:
# 1. Addition of `steps: List["Step"]`: This field allows a step to contain a
#    list of its own sub-steps that should be executed serially. This enables
#    arbitrarily deep, recursive plan execution, all handled by the PlanRunner's
#    unified execution logic.
# 2. Addition of `parallel_steps: List["Step"]`: This field allows a step to
#    contain a list of sub-steps that should be executed concurrently. This is
#    the hook the `PlanRunner` uses to invoke its thread-based parallelism.
# 3. Auto-Labeling: The `__post_init__` method now automatically assigns a
#    unique label (e.g., `_step0`) if one isn't provided. This ensures that
#    every step can be referenced, which is vital for the `on_success` logic.
# 4. The previous validation error for having both `steps` and `parallel_steps`
#    was removed, as per the final requirement to process both if present.
