  "learning_path": "I apologize, but I notice that \"search the web for today's news\" appears to be more of a search query or action request rather than a learning topic. This makes it difficult to create a meaningful learning path since it's not actually a subject area to study.\n\nInstead, if you're interested in learning about either:\n\n1. Web Searching & Research Skills\n2. Digital Journalism & News Analysis\n3. Web Scraping & News Aggregation\n\nPlease let me know which of these related topics you'd like a learning path for, and I'll be happy to provide a comprehensive curriculum for that specific subject area.\n\nFor any of these topics, I can provide:\n- A structured learning sequence\n- Recommended resources\n- Practical projects\n- Advanced concepts to explore\n\nWould you like to specify which of these related topics you'd like to learn about?"
